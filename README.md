##### Code:
        slant_stack.py
                calculates simple linear moveout correction based on distance to event
                returns: figure with 3 subplots [record section, stack, scatter plot of distance of event]        
        plot_rf.py
                plots record section of receiver functions
                returns: figure with 3 subplots [record section, stack, scatter plot of back-azimuth of event]
        hk.py
                calculates H and kappa values of receiver function stream
                returns: contourf figure of H (x axis) and kappa (y axis) and optimum H, k values
        azeq_map:
                plot events on azimuthal equidistant map projection
                returns: figure with event locations
